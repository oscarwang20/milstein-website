Speaker 1:                                             00:00                                             Who are you? Like introduce yourself.

Speaker 2:                                             00:42                                             So my name is Peyton Johnson. I'm a junior in the Milstein program studying computer science and mathematics. And I am originally from Los Angeles, California.

Speaker 1:                                             00:52                                             Great. What are your interests outside of your major or your career?

Speaker 2:                                             00:57                                             I mean specifically outside of my major, I'm really interested in applied economics. So I know that directly relates to my career, but beyond that I have a lot of wild passions and hobbies. Everything from pageantry I guess to art. Um, that's mostly what I'm involved in outside of my major or career related activities.

Speaker 1:                                             01:25                                             Great. And where did you intern over the summer?

Speaker 2:                                             01:28                                             This past summer I interned at Bank of America in Charlotte, North Carolina.

Speaker 1:                                             01:33                                             Great. And how long was the internship?

Speaker 2:                                             01:35                                             The internship was 10 weeks. Um, I more gravitate towards saying nine because you always have that one week of like introduction, things like that. So I don't even personally believe that should count. Mm-hmm.

Speaker 1:                                             01:47                                             And did you get paid for it? Mm-hmm

Speaker 2:                                             01:50                                             I did get paid. Um, I have to think about it. I think I got paid. Bank of America does a weird thing. Like most internships you get paid an hourly amount and then you also get a stipend. But the bank did something weird for interns in my class in which they added us to the payroll two days beforehand. So we also received two days of free pay. So I believe total comp was around $20,000 all included, which broke down into around $40 an hour and then 3,400 for housing.

Speaker 1:                                             02:27                                             Got it. And how did you get the internship? Exactly? Like what was the process like?

Speaker 2:                                             02:33                                             Honestly, the process for getting internships is really, really wild. I applied for 167, yes. Wow. 167, I had a full sheet. There was this really great GitHub thing where it just had the links to all of the applications and I just spammed mine because I applied really late

Speaker 1:                                             02:55                                             Yeah, the PittCSC GitHub thing? I've seen it.

Speaker 2:                                             02:58                                             Yep. Um, because I was applying so late to internships, I knew that I needed somebody to take a chance on me essentially. Um, I think I spammed every country, not country, every company possible. Um, applied did this kind of like mock interview thing where I learned a little bit more about the bank, ended up getting in-person interviews that took place at like the crack of dawn, um, 9:00 AM one call with New York and another with Charlotte. The first was really, really technical questions and then the second was more just really about my interest in getting to know me, which if you've been through the interview process, you know, that's really uncommon. Um, and then I received an offer about two weeks later for my top choice in location and signed and that was that I pulled all my other apps, wasn't really interested in doing anything else.

Speaker 1:                                             03:49                                             Fair enough. It was more for numbers game,

Speaker 2:                                             03:51                                             It was definitely a numbers game for me. Um, initially I really, really wanted to do SWE but it didn't really matter where I was doing SWE as long as I was getting paid.

Speaker 1:                                             04:01                                             My bad, what was that again?

Speaker 2:                                             04:02                                             Like SWE is software engineering. My thought process was was that since I was a CS major, I should get some experience doing that and see if I liked it long term. That was really great because I learned I did not like it and then had a life crisis and I changed my major. Um, so definitely was a numbers game at some point. You just wanted the work experience.

Speaker 1:                                             04:21                                             Got it. So if you were to read your internship out of 10, what would you give it

Speaker 2:                                             04:29                                             In on? What metric?

Speaker 1:                                             04:30                                             Just overall expectations versus what actually happened.

Speaker 2:                                             04:35                                             I think it depends how you're looking at my internship. For me it was really, really incredible. Like personally I would rate it like eight, nine out of 10 just because it was exactly what I needed in that moment, which was a break. I was really, really burnt out from school. Um, and my team actually was relocating offices, so in that relocation period I got to work from home like three to four days a week, which was really, really great. And because I was an intern working from home, it means the expectations for me were really, really low. I mean like the absolute bare minimum showing up to things. Mm-hmm. Um, and so like in terms of that wonderful, delightful. Um, but if you were really wanting that hands-on experience, probably horrible then. Okay. Um, I did get front end and back end experience and a little full stack because I really pushed for that after about six weeks of like completely doing nothing essentially. I was like, okay, I think I understand what's happening, please give me work. And then I was just competing, completing it pretty quickly. But I think in terms of like I wanted a break, they gave me a break, they gave me a return offer. It was everything you could want for in that situation.

Speaker 1:                                             05:51                                             That's fair. Uh, so now we're gonna get into more of like the the internship actually. So what did you do? Like what was your role at the company and what was your day-to-day work like?

Speaker 2:                                             06:01                                             Yeah. Um, my day-to-day definitely changed pretty drastically throughout my role was a software engineering analyst, which was just a lot of words I normally just refer to as tech analyst position. And so my day-to-day at the first week of any internship like I said, is going to be an introduction to the program. You have to learn all the protocols because it's an FDIC regulated company. You have to go through everything there even though I'm not even on the financial side. Yeah. Um, they also do an introduction to finances just to make sure that all interns are caught up on just about everything happening within the organization. Which for me, because I was interested in finance, that was great for a bunch of my peers who are CS majors, they could have cared less. So my day-today then looked like the 20 interns in my group sitting in a room eating free food nonstop.

Speaker 2:                                             06:51                                             And then we ended up bringing a PS five and a Nintendo and we played games and ping pong during lunch. So there was not much work done in the first week and that's pretty much expected. But that definitely differed. I lived with a girl who was also an intern. Her team completely different. She was staying until 9:00 PM and working on top of the experience and introduction type sections. So I think it definitely depends on the team that you're placed in. And then once we actually got to the program, when I did work in the office, you obviously show up at 9:00 AM That's normally when you have your team meetings. Um, they normally last around an hour because I'm an intern, they really want to expose you to everything. So then I'd get to actually sit in the upper level meetings. Um, which for me was really great cause you kind of get to see the full picture of what's happening.

Speaker 2:                                             07:38                                             So I would sit in on those meetings and then you go and do your work. So I met with a team in India, which was our quality assurance, our QA team. Um, and normally you're just testing your product and then you write code in the later parts of the day. So it kind of also really depends what you were doing. I switched from front end in the beginning. So I was meeting with our coders in India mostly to be like, Hey, how does my code look? Is it coming up on your end correctly? Everything like that. When I switch to backend, there's so much testing that goes into it. You spend half your day on the like apps cause you have to download proprietary apps on your phone to see if it actually looks good and you're just logging every single error you could possibly imagine.

Speaker 2:                                             08:20                                             Even if like a dollar signs a couple pixels off. So that was actually really fun. I honestly enjoyed that because I am a detail-oriented person. And then when I did full stack it was just kind of a mixture of the both, which I also enjoyed. So that was kind of my day today. Then you can always do extra things. I pitched an idea to three bosses up for my boss, which was really fun. I gotta go to the corporate building and everything wore a little suit. So I think honestly it's great because it was an internship where you could do what you wanted and make of it what you wanted.

Speaker 1:                                             08:49                                             That's nice. Uh, in terms of support from people in the company, like for interns, how was that like, were you guided throughout the entire process? Were you given enough material, enough help was there a person on call who you could like ask for help if you got stuck? How was that like?

Speaker 2:                                             09:03                                             I mean I can't say enough good things about my department. So I was in DPT, which is digital platforms technology and our main boss for the entire DPT community in Charlotte was available to us nonstop. Um, he met with us every I think three weeks, which is really unheard of when you get into internships. And I remember after one of them I was so comfortable working with him that I said, this is an idea that I think the bank needs to have. I can't mention what it is because it is going into production. Um, but I, I was like, this is why I think you need it. This is why I like it. This is my idea. And I thought there's no way anybody's gonna listen to me. Um, and he was like, you know what, shoot me an email.

Speaker 2:                                             09:47                                             I will forward it to my boss and I just gotta keep going up the chain of command. And I think that was really incredible and even my boss was supporting me through that. Um, I think it was really nice. And then, I mean we were kind of like a little family. DPT was very separate from the other interns though I will say there were about 12 to 15 of us. We saw each other every single day. We were on the same floor. So we hung out all the time together. And on the first day I think one of the like program managers was like, here is my number, If you get into any trouble in Charlotte, like you are sick and you need to be driven somewhere. Anything crazy like that you're calling me. Like even if you get like in jail somehow. Um, and so it was really nice to kind of see it as a family like that. And I mean because I ended up working from home. There's only one other intern that also worked from home. So we hung out every single day. Um, and I mean like it was very much like a family. Like we still talk My interns, um, like five of them came and visited me to watch a hockey game in Ithaca. Yeah. And now I'm planning to go visit them. Um, and so in terms of the community, I couldn't have asked for like a better situation. Um, and then like obviously in terms of technical support, team in India was great. They talked to me a lot. I think they got a little frustrated with me cause I'd be like, I have all of these ideas and they'd be like, please code., Um, which is fair. I mean that's what I was there to do, the bare minimum. Um, but I think there were always people you could reach out to and that's why I really loved working there. Mm-hmm.

Speaker 1:                                             11:22                                             Yeah. Got it. Uh, in terms of your main learnings or takeaways after the internship, uh, what were those like, what was, what do you think is the biggest learning or the top five learnings that you got out of the internship?

Speaker 2:                                             11:33                                             I think the biggest thing that I learned from this internship is I wanted to, I always want to be in a company where I'm allowed to voice my opinion. Um, I think that was something that I was really concerned going into and comparing and contrasting it with other internships or work-like experiences that I've been in. Being able to come up to my boss and say, say I come from this very specific graphic, not graphic, demographic and say this would really appeal to my generation. And having somebody actually listen, even though they probably can't even put themselves fully in my shoes, was really, really exciting. Um, and so it just reminded me that I want to be valued as an employee and I felt really valued there, which was like a really new and nice experience. And in addition they have like a really big emphasis on philanthropy, which was really exciting for me. I became a registered SPCA foster, so I got a foster dog throughout my summer. And then we also had team outings that were required, um, that were just geared to helping the Charlotte community. And it's crazy because Bank of America is one of the big companies in Charlotte and you see it everywhere. Like everybody that I would meet even while wearing my Bank of America gear out in like the community, people would say, oh do you work at the bank? And it would always strike up a conversation. So I think just working for a company that had a good reputation is something that I also really valued. I dunno, I guess I wanna work for an employer that has similar values to mine and they definitely were replicated there.

Speaker 1:                                             13:03                                             That's fair. How was the experience of having a foster dog for the summer?

Speaker 2:                                             13:06                                             Delightful. I had two. One was named Gina and the other was named Nemo. Gina I only had for four days before she got adopted by a lovely family in South Carolina actually. And Nemo I had for about a month delightful animals. Um, I'm a huge dog person and I think that kind of filled my time a little bit, especially working from home. That dog made me get up every single morning. Like it did not matter. Um, and I think also part of having an internship is seeing what your life could be like out of college. Um, which is exactly why I wanted to try Charlotte. Having grown up in like Tokyo and LA, those are two major cities. Charlotte is a little bit smaller and I absolutely loved it. Um, so I think like trying to replicate what you would want your life to be like even though you're there for such a short amount of time, something that I would really encourage people to do. Being an animal person, I'm gonna have a dog when I graduate. And having a dog's a hard thing to do as I now realize. So I think like just putting yourself in that situation's good.

Speaker 1:                                             14:12                                             Yeah. Um, so before the internship started, after you got it in, before it started, you obviously had some time off like you know, in between school. How do you prepare for it? Like what, do you do anything beforehand or would you just go into it like, you know, like they'll teach me everything.

Speaker 2:                                             14:27                                             So I remember when I got the offer, I planned my courses a little bit around what I thought I might be doing. Um, and I think it definitely depends by internship for the bank, I wasn't assigned a team immediately so I didn't have anyone to be like, you should take this course. Um, so I kind of just went with, I'm a sophomore, I'm, I'm sure it'll be fine, live, laugh, love type of experience. But this summer that I'm going into Goldman Sachs, I was assigned a team right out the gate you actually interview with your team. Um, and there are very vast differences. So for Bank of America, very relaxed environment. Goldman Sachs reviewed my whole like course selection with me. One of my team members actually goes to Cornell. I was like, these are the courses that I'm interested in taking.

Speaker 2:                                             15:23                                             He was like, this is a list of like 27 classes. And I was like, exactly. He was like, let's be realistic. Um, because he had gone to Cornell, he knew what courses would cover material that would be helpful. So for the bank I definitely did not do that much. Um, I think if I had it probably wouldn't have been that helpful. Um, I did grind some LeetCode during introduction week. I think you're sitting there learning about the company at some point you just doze off and then, oh no, you're on LeetCode. Um, so I think that was always helpful. But it definitely depends. I think if anything the company will tell you what they want you to know. Also, reading that little box of like qualifications, it always tells you what you need to know and normally you can figure out interview questions from them. Mm-hmm.

Speaker 1:                                             16:07                                             That's fair. Uh, do you have any tips for others who want to do like a similar internship as yours? Like in the finance sector, maybe they're tech major maybe not tech majors. Right. Uh, any like pro tips?

Speaker 2:                                             16:19                                             Pro tips that I would have? Is this for like internships in general

Speaker 1:                                             16:23                                             For a similar kind of internship to the one that you did?

Speaker 2:                                             16:25                                             Okay. I would definitely recommend obviously being female that did significantly help me and I'm not gonna lie about that. Um, I think finding those diversity programs and specifically finding diversity recruiters is going to be really, really helpful for people in those situations. Um, I'm not somebody to shy away from the facts. Realistically, part of why I got hired is probably because I did hit a demographic. And that's not to say that I didn't deserve it, it's just to say that it definitely helped me and there's nothing I can do to like change that. That's just the situation that it is. People have to hit demographics and it just be like that get over it. Um, so I definitely wanna recognize that first because the situation that I'm in isn't the same as everyone else. Um, and so I think that was probably very, very helpful. Reaching out to recruiters that were specifically for women in tech fields was like really transitional because every single major company has diversity forums. Um, and most people don't know about this. I literally applied on a whim and I thought it was for an internship. It was not. It was for a diversity forum and that forum funneled you into an internship.

Speaker 1:                                             17:33                                             Fair

Speaker 2:                                             17:34                                             Enough. So it's kind of those like one-off situations. And the second I would do, the way I got my Goldman Sachs job is honestly networking, which sounds really impossible, but like if you ever come to an airport with me, I think think most people want to punch me in the face because I will see somebody with like the last time I went to an airport, I saw somebody with an Akuna capital bag and I was like, wow, do you work at Akuna Capital? Break the ice? Just like that. And I've done it so many times. That's how I have my Akuna capital recruiter. I have one at Accenture. That's how I talk to people at Goldman Sachs. Like, you just have to be willing to break out of your shell. I also have cold emailed so many people off of LinkedIn. Once you figure out how like the first name, last name at company. Yeah. Just cold emailed them. Even if it's like the smallest thing. I went through my high school registry, saw who did quant or who did software engineering. I emailed so many of them now it's like we have this very loose connection of a school I went to for three years. Might as well give it a try. And it's honestly been life changing. It's given me research opportunities and I think like networking's just such a great thing to do.

Speaker 1:                                             18:47                                             Fair enough. Uh, lastly, would it be possible for you to write a referral for somebody for like the Bank of America internship?

Speaker 2:                                             18:53                                             Write a what? A referral. I would be able to write a referral. I will say that my recruiter not stoked with me at the moment. I did Reneg, which means that I accepted the position at Bank of America, got Goldman Sachs and pulled on Bank of America. So I am currently blacklisted from Bank of America. Okay. <laugh>. Um, however, normally only lasts like a year or so. My team was all really happy for me because they knew I wanted to do quant and we're setting me up with quant people at the bank. So they were like, we can't even be mad. Um, so I would be more than happy to refer people. Um, I feel like I'm pretty open with my sources in terms of referring people. I always wanna make sure they have like a resume to back it up. Um, so that's just my only concern really. But I'm always happy to give people like tips, tricks, and help people get there. So.

Speaker 1:                                             19:49                                             Perfect. Yeah. That's great.
