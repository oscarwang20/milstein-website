Peyton:                                                00:00                                             An internship is, see a lot of hands, keep that hand raised. If you know what an externship is, I see many fewer hands. So to give a quick overview, the Millstein program has offered funding to a happy internship, which essentially is a three day course in which you're able to go and shadow an individual at either a program, a academic institution, or even a company that you are just really interested in. And normally it coincides with your junior project. For me, I'm working with Elena Ault to Do Map CTown, which is a comprehensive map of college town rental listings, which sounds like a really big task and is something that we didn't realize was gonna be so hard to do until we actually got here. So as a part of my externship, I was able to shadow somebody named Nicholas Hafner at the Host Co, which works with other small rentals to increase their profit margins through a variety of ways. They work with third party retailers to provide really incredible experiences, whether it's cleaning while you're at an Airbnb, groceries delivered upon your arrival, anything that you could think of, they have it. And so with my internship, I headed all the way out to Boston and externship, excuse me, it's my externship. I headed all the way out to Boston and I was really excited because the Host Co is a startup that recently partnered with Airbnb. And I just wanna see what it was like. I think a lot of us have interest in going into the startup field. And so I was so excited to be a part of one, even if for a couple of days. And at the start it was just as hectic as I thought it would be. Um, immediately we realized that there was an error in the program. And so their software primarily relies on emails being sent to the third party vendor, to the people within the Host Co and then also to the person that actually has the Airbnb. We noticed that around 10% of the emails were not being delivered. This is a problem when you have over 2000 Airbnbs on your platform. And so immediately we jumped into solutions. The individual I was working with had no coding or tech background and so we had to find non-coding solutions. And throughout this entire process I was just constantly reminded of how exciting it is to be in a really small startup. Um, working around with things that you understand and then being able to apply those in situations where you may not necessarily have any expertise. And that was honestly just the best part of my externship, being able to see how you can use what you know to apply to problems that are really, really difficult. So while we ended up with a non-coding solution, we also were able to find solutions that did implement code with my background. So we started using a couple of different softwares to see what we could do and see if we could add a couple of short programs that he understood and that I could very well explain to make sure that everyone was clear and concise on what we were doing. Since then, they have definitely solved the problem many of their backend developers, but it was just really exciting to be able to be in that position, just such a fast-paced environment. And then in addition to that externship part, I was really excited because they're gonna be taking on some new interns. And having been in college and gone to an internship last year, I was able to give a lot of insights of what we as students actually want in these experiences. We don't wanna sit there and be a glorified coffee individual or somebody that's just sitting in these meetings having absolutely no clue as to what is happening. And so I explained my side of things, what happened at past internships and how they could really implement an internship program that would be really helpful for students, especially first and second years. So that was kind of the bulk of my internship and during the round table kind of discussion later with the um, networking event, I'll be happy to talk more about those internship opportunities. But in the meantime, I'm gonna pass it off to Dumebi to talk about his

Dumebi:                                                04:00                                             Thank you Peyton, for today. Is it recording? I'll take this a yes. Thank you Peyton for the introduction. Hi everyone. If you don't know me already, my name is Chu du Joshua Obi. You can call me Dumebi for short. I'm a senior in the Millstein program. I'm majoring in sociology and I am doing, I also doing a minor in data science. And for my externship, I visited a friend of mine, Jeremy Klein, class of 2022. He's an AEP major, so he's, so he did engineering and applied physics and his specialty was in quantum computing. And I went to visit him at mass at MIT also in Boston on Valentine's Day weekend to hear about his love for his work. He specifically focuses on, and I'm just gonna give the technical term, it's non-linear coupling. It's a type of, it's a type of phenomena in quantum computing circuits where you're trying to use one Quibit. So Quibit is a, is a, the quantum computing analog for a bit a bit is a, is a math, is a math abstraction that could take the state of one or zero. Qubits can take more states than one in, than one in zero. And he's just trying to find out how to better create the vi create machines that can enable one qubit to me to observe the another qubit without breaking down because these qubits are very, very fragile within microseconds. They're gone. That's just a bit of the technical overview. And I also, fortunately for me, some of my other friends were going to a conference at the same time. So Jeremy and I, we got to meet mutual friends. I took Jeremy for out for lunch, dinner and lunch on Sunday. If you want to get, oh, sorry. If you want to get a scientist time, always offer food <laugh>. So that was really nice. And I also got to hear about what the research experience is like at the PhD level. Oftentimes, luckily there's not that that much schoolwork. So if you love research and you, you don't and you don't want to go through all the hassle of schoolwork, but you really love a topic, a PhD program might be something you might consider. So now drilling down into what he does on a, on a day-to-day basis, a lot of his work is done through computer and his lab has a remote server that he gets that he connects to. And he, and they have qu they have their own machines that they've devised in their lab. A lot of liquid nitrogen, a lot of liquid nitrogen like, like the machine. It's like, it looks like it's made outta like gold and it's a huge machine made out of gold only to measure like the big, a really huge machine to measure very tiny particle. It's, that's one of the interesting things about the working on the quantum scale and the type of dynamics. I go his hope he just started his PhD program. So he's excited for what the remaining four to six years have for him. Yes, a PhD program is that long, but that's what it takes sometimes to break new ground. You need to give yourself time and I just got to learn more about that. I'm not gonna major, I'm not going to do a PhD in quantum computing, but I just found it as a sociologist how people who conduct science, what their, what is like in their community and what values they have and what and how the, how changes in technology is enabling their, them to conduct their practice as scientists in a different way compared to the olden days where you had to write everything by hand. Mm-hmm <affirmative>. Uh, so that's a brief, that's my brief introdu, that's my brief explanation of my externship during the networking panel. Please feel free to ask, I'll be more than happy to ask to answer any questions you have and I'll pass it off to Coco,

Coco:                                                  07:41                                             Thank you to maybe. So I'm Coco and I'm a junior majoring in computer science and psychology. And so for my externship, so fun. I also went to Boston <laugh> and I also went to mit. So um, I was attending a MIT media lab hosted event, um, called the MIT reality app, which basically brings over people from different parts of the world that are interested in virtual reality and augmented reality. Um, so I did my internship during winter break and it was a really fun experience because um, the MIT media lab brought in so many company involved in virtual reality and augmented reality. So I didn't like specifically shadow like one specific company or one specific student. Instead I was involved with a lot of different like, um, big companies such as Unity and Pico and like, um, Meta Quest, um, which are all like big companies out there. So it was like a really great opportunity to shadow all of these, um, at once. And I, during that event, I also like got to meet a lot of like different people that are interested in the same op like subject as me. And um, it was a really great like connection experience and I learned a lot. Um, and also for the project that I did for the externship. So I was working with a, um, PhD candidate of bioengineering at Stanford, um, and another like healthcare, um, expert in India and like two other undergrads at like schools around like United States. Um, so what we basically did was we created a virtual reality app that visualizes pain and provides like treatment for how like people could actually do in virtual reality so that they don't actually have to go to a doctor, we bring the doctor to them. Um, so it was a really fun experience because I got to learn a lot, um, in the field and connect with a lot of people. So like during the intern like networking panel, like um, I would be really happy to like connect people with, um, like academics or professionals or industry, um, in virtual reality and augmented reality and like answer some questions that people might have. Thank you.

Peyton:                                                10:09                                             Those sound really incredible and very difficult to do. We're gonna pass it off to many of our audience members. If you have questions that could relate to all three of us or even just one of us, this is your time to ask them and it's gonna be a pretty open forum right now. And then after That we'll move to a networking event that will last for the remainder of the evening. If, if any questions feel free to just jump in. We're not gonna do raised hands or anything like that. It'll be pretty informal.

Dumebi:                                                10:49                                             Peyton, I have a question.

Peyton:                                                10:50                                             Go ahead. This

Dumebi:                                                10:51                                             Question for both, going from Peyton, which is how did you two find this person or this event? Were you just browsing the MIT website? Did you look up the host and dig down a little bit? So just tell us about how you identify the person you were gonna contact.

Coco:                                                  11:06                                             Yeah, so basically for me, um, I have friends that are also interested in the same aspect. Like I'm also involved in a virtual reality lab at Cornell. So they actually like kind of like referred this event to me and I was like, oh this looks really fun and like really inspiring. So that's why like I found a bit,

Peyton:                                                11:24                                             I'm pretty sure almost everyone in this room has gotten a LinkedIn request from me <laugh>. So I think the power of social media was absolutely huge in this. Um, initially I didn't really know who I wanted to go and maybe do an externship with, especially because my junior project changed so much and so I hopped onto LinkedIn and I started going through my connections and I was like, I pretty much knew I wanted to do a startup. Um, so I started looking for company ma names that I didn't necessarily know, which sounds a little counterintuitive to how most of us use LinkedIn. And I opened a ton of different tabs and then I essentially just started reaching out to people and I got a lot of responses and that was really exciting for me just because never really know how people are going to react and the Host Co actually fit the profile for what I'm doing with my junior project perfectly. Um, and then as it got closer to the date, we realized that the Boston kind of situation lined up because Nicholas is actually located in Salt Lake City. And then from there I just continued reaching out to people knowing that I was going to Boston if there was anything else that I could do. And my older sister actually had a connection in Boston named Nathaniel and he worked at more of a lab type setting. So I also just reached out to him, see if we could grab coffee and learn about what he does just so that I could get even a better picture of the different opportunities you have after graduation.

Dumebi:                                                12:47                                             Fantastic. Did you guys take the bus? How'd you get there?

Coco:                                                  12:51                                             Plane

Dumebi:                                                12:51                                             from Syracuse?

Coco:                                                  12:53                                             Um, no I wouldn't put em in Pennsylvania.

Dumebi:                                                12:55                                             Oh, okay.

Dumebi:                                                12:57                                             You drove didn't you

Peyton:                                                12:58                                             Paid? I drove. Um, it's

Dumebi:                                                13:00                                             Long. I took the, our bus. Yeah. Yeah. 8:00 AM eight hours out. I mean it's, I don't have a car plane. I already traveled by plane early in the month. And bus no underrated. Buse is underrated.

Audience Member:                                       13:26                                             Um, um, was externship related to your junior projects and what are you bringing back from the externships to your degree to your projects?

Coco:                                                  13:34                                             So for our junior project, um, initially Alita and I was planning to work on a virtual reality project. Um, so that's like why I like thought about this event, but like we slightly divert track from our initial like project that we were working on. Um, but instead like we're working on aspects and computer vision and hardware, which I also have like, um, exposure doing that event on like how we can use like vision to identify things and how we can like actually like get our hands on hardware. So I feel like that experience is like how I could bring back to the project.

Peyton:                                                14:14                                             Yeah. And then my junior project is called Map CTown with Elena Ault where we're creating a comprehensive work. That's our dream goal is to create a comprehensive map of rental listings in college town. Whereas many of you probably know renting in Ithaca is horrible, meaning that this information is not widely available. Landlords for some reason like to keep it to themselves, not really sure why. Um, and so it really connected well with my internship because the Host Co right now is growing really rapidly. They were started I think back in 2018 or 2019, although they would not quote me on that. And they've grown to over 2,200 Airbnb listings at the moment. Um, and that's just on their Airbnb side. And so I had this grand vision where we were gonna be able to map all of College Town. It was gonna be this sick interactive map, you're gonna be able to click on places, they're gonna be photos that is not realistic <laugh>, I have other classes I like, have other things to do with my life. And so Nick really brought me down to earth along with a bunch of the different meetings that I've had with the Millstein program of let, let's start on College Ave, maybe a block or two. Um, and so that was actually really helpful. He actually talked about a lot of the issues that the Host Co initially had when they were starting, especially with selling your product. I have to go and I have a long list of phone numbers of lovely landlords. I get to call in Ithaca and I'm essentially going to be begging for some rental information from them. Mm-hmm. <affirmative> just to see if they're even gonna give it to me. And the host co had a very similar problem. How do we get people to buy into our product? Um, and so we started talking about customer success and that's actually what Nick does at the host. So I was able to see that people facing side, especially being a CS major, I'm doing the code. I do not see people. I like my desk and I like my computer, but we're working on changing that. Um, and so Elena and I kind of swapped roles a little bit here and I was on the people side and she was on the tech.

Peyton:                                                16:10                                             Go ahead. Did

Audience:                                              16:11                                             You run into any NDA type issues while you were trying to find people and how many times did you fail

Dumebi:                                                16:18                                             <laugh>? I guess I can start on the question of NDAs. I, I didn't technically have to sign one, but I'm not, I didn't, but I wasn't allowed to. I, in talking to Jeremy to get in touch with, I wasn't allowed to take photos of what I saw at the lab because at least with science research at the, at least with science research and labs, many labs are rightfully very careful about what they release to the public. And all, all labs are very careful about how their reputation is managed. So taking photos, writing about them, citing them, they're very careful about what you say and how you say and when. So I made a compromise where I do not, I did not take any photos of my time while shadowing Jeremy and an exchange I didn't have to get into a formal grant. I did have to sign an indem, an indemnification form. Thank you Maya, for providing me that paperwork. Always get your paperwork sorted early before you go on these externships. In terms of how many times I failed Ryan, I technically Jeremy was the first person I really looked out for, but that's if you're, that's if I'm discounting all the other people I saw on LinkedIn and was too and felt I was too and felt like didn't wasn't good enough to ask them. Yeah,

Peyton:                                                17:41                                             I don't think there were too many NDAs. Um, I didn't sign any, most of them were essentially like silent unspoken rules. Um, specifically working on the internship stuff. I can't talk about all of the initial ideas or things that are happening in the background there. I can give you guys the lovely piece of paperwork I have on like the qualifications and things like that. You're obviously not really allowed to talk about like proprietary software, things like that. So when you are going on these externships, anything they give you treat it like a prize cause they don't have to do this. Like they're doing this out of the kindness of their heart. So if you think it could hurt their business model or anything like that, I feel like that's just kind of the thought process I was taking going into this.

Coco:                                                  18:22                                             So for me, I don't really have to sign NDAs cuz it's like an event, but there are, and we like basically did the projects to ourselves so it belongs to us. But there are some like unreleased models of the um, like the VR headsets of like some companies. But um, I think that it's included within like the thing we signed for the event. So, um, the paperwork is already done for us.

Dumebi:                                                18:51                                             Someone else have a question I thought I saw had. Yes. Max.

Audeince:                                              18:56                                             Um, I guess my question is sort of did you guys, you guys did you, did you guys like sort of, you guys obviously did things very, I think for maybe particularly did things very distinct from your own field mm-hmm. <affirmative>. So I guess my question is sort of what are the restrictions on who we shadow and how related it has to be to our field of study or your junior product projects? Could we just pick someone like in a totally different field mm-hmm. <affirmative>, like if I could pick a doctor for example with that work or like, cause it had to fit

Peyton:                                                19:22                                             Speaking from like what we were given from the externship for juniors, which is normally when we're going to be doing these externships, it shouldn't somehow be related to your junior project so that you get some benefit that you can bring back to the most program potentially like improve your project in some way, shape or form. For me, I'm on the tech side of my project, so I don't necessarily do the people facing part. Um, once again CS major. Um, and so in this I kind of talked to Elena and said I want to take on more of a people facing role. It's something that I don't get to do in my everyday today. And we kind of just worked that into our project. I would say if I went and I was like, I want to go visit, I don't know, like a neurosurgeon in Boston, I would have to find some argument that it could pertain to my map CTown project or in some other benefit to the program in some way, shape, or form. I feel like if it's something you're really passionate about and maybe you wanna do like a mini side project as well, there's probably some way you could talk to Maya, Austin, get that done. Mm-hmm. <affirmative>,

Austin:                                                20:29                                             Thank you for that clarification. Yeah. Just to follow up, max, the idea is just connect the dots. We want your junior projects to like be a part of what you're into, what you're genuinely interested in pursuing. So finding somebody <laugh> cameras on me, but, so finding somebody that you can go visit from your externship would naturally put from that because ideally it's, it's in the stream of your interest and your career path. I think Maya, um, and I are really flexible in understanding though, and one thing we should mention is you can also do these externships the fall of your senior year. So that would be after your junior project. So in that regard, it would be more career path oriented. Good. If you were interested in going pre-med and wanted to go talk to the doctor, that could make, that could work too. Okay.

Dumebi:                                                21:09                                             So just to understand, you're asking about what's the restriction on who you can ask and then what was the second portion of your question? Basically that? Yeah. Okay. So at least for me, like I, so I knew Jeremy before I shadowed him. I knew him, I knew him through someone in the program. Um, Dana, she did research physics, she majored in physics, physics research here and she mentioned him. I also knew him through mutual friends in the dorm where I live in. So I had a prior, prior, prior, prior relationship where just keeping in touch, talking through Messenger at checking in on each other. You know, it's really important to maintain the relationships you have and the research you build while you're in school. Because what one we, each of us will go different paths and you don't know where your paths will meet up.

Dumebi:                                                21:56                                             Mm-hmm. <affirmative>, um, that's a little, little PSA there. And then the second one is I don't, I I I applied for the externship in the fall of my senior year. Um, and yes, I have not taken physics since high school, but I asked Jeremy. This is other part about asking people beyond a field you don't know is how many humility. Humility to one, recognize you don't know it. And then have someone who's willing to give you the resources or set you down and explain it. So Jeremy was kind of to give me a quantum computing textbook, uh, like a pdf. I tried reading it <laugh>, I took a break, I took a break, I took a break from it. I read his, I read his research group's papers when I was writing the externship application. Took me a few hours, but it was worth, it was worth the investment. So just also being willing to put in the work to catch up on the subject. And again, no one's expecting you to be a subject matter. No expect you to defend, write a thesis and defend it. But at least having a general understanding of what it is the person does is a really good step if you want to shadow the person.

Peyton:                                                23:04                                             I also talked to my individual, well beforehand, they're going to reorganization. So getting a sense of what's happening in the organization. Just that when you get there, they don't have to do all that catching up as soon as you like touch ground. Um, it's really, really helpful because then you can actually be a part of their work day rather than just getting things explained to you. You can actually see it in progress.

Audience:                                              23:31                                             I had a question, um, about VR. Um, so I guess how, um, have you gotten involved with it? How can you get, how can you get involved in, at Cornell and like learning more about like VR and AR then? Um, yeah.

Coco:                                                  23:43                                             I feel like, um, there isn't a lot of resources at Cornell that can get you like really hands on vr. I know that Millstein program owns a lot of VR headsets, so, and you can borrow from them to like, like experiment or play a little on your own. And I know there is also a lab, um, under communications department called Virtual Embodiment Lab, um, which I think Professor Wong also have like connections with the <INAUDIBLE> program and I worked with her um, last year. She's a really good professor that could kind of like lead you to like virtual reality. Yeah. Um, but like beyond that, I feel like, um, at Cornell specifically, there isn't like a lot of resources just on campus or a lot of like, people just, um, exclusively focusing on that area. But yeah, you're welcome to like talk more.

Dumebi:                                                24:40                                             I'll just chime in there. Learning a related skill Yeah. Can help you get enter ease into, into virtual reality. Reality. Mm-hmm. <affirmative>. So I taught myself Blender. It's a free open source. I always support those. 3D program. 3D program. And I taught it to myself shortly before coming to school. And then during the Milstein Summer program when I, Jeff and I did it, I helped design the models in 3D for VR and for augmented reality. Um, so 3D modeling, it's not really, again, something that's really common here in arts and sciences. A lot of the engineers do it or CVI or in our key people do it, but there's like LinkedIn learning courses we should get for free through your Cornell, my Cornell student. Just a lot of ex experimenting and patience is needed for that.

Audience:                                              25:28                                             Thanks.

Austin:                                                25:29                                             What's LinkedIn learning by the way? That's a is it like Linda?

Dumebi:                                                25:32                                             Yes, it's LinkedIn bought Linda. It is.

Austin:                                                25:35                                             Oh really? Oh

Dumebi:                                                25:36                                             They bought them out. Same thing. Yes.

Audience:                                              25:40                                             Yes. Uh, what was applying for the externship, uh, opportunity? Like in general, like did you have to do this? Like was it completely through Millstein? Like what did that look like? Just filling out a form or?

Peyton:                                                25:50                                             It's completely through Millstein. Um, you essentially submit dates, you submit an it mock itinerary can be a little loose. Um, cause things always change. You submit a budget, um, and obviously that's an initial budget. Things can change and it did go with the federal and I think we all did. Yes. The continental United States. Yes.

Dumebi:                                                26:13                                             The GSA general service administration per diem rates.

Peyton:                                                26:16                                             Perfect. Goes with those per diem rates. And then you submit a nice little paragraph on what you wanna do, why it's gonna be beneficial to you if it relates to your junior project, um, if you're a junior obviously just things like that. And it's pretty simple from there. You just send it to Maya and get a little feedback on it and go from there.

Austin:                                                26:34                                             Don't forget the reflection paper for you guys, right? What's that? Oh yes,

Peyton:                                                26:37                                             Yes.

Coco:                                                  26:37                                             We have

Peyton:                                                26:38                                             A lovely two page reflection has not been specified because single or double space. So I think we are taking the liberty of double space. Don't worry. Mine's four pages. One, one and a half. Mine's four pages. Don't worry. Oh yeah.

Dumebi:                                                26:50                                             I'm writing my single <laugh> writing two pages. Yeah.

Peyton:                                                26:54                                             Should be clarified. College kids like to cut corners.

Austin:                                                26:57                                             But good question though because you guys are gonna write this reflection by your experience when you took away how you might apply it to your junior project. You're staring at the faces of Saksham and Rolando who are building this internship site. Can they take those reflections and put them on that website?

Dumebi:                                                27:10                                             Sure,

Peyton:                                                27:12                                             Yes. They can take it because it's going to stay within the Milstein community so you don't have to worry about outsiders viewing it. Great.

Dumebi:                                                27:18                                             Mm-hmm. <affirmative>.

Dumebi:                                                27:21                                             Excellent. Okay. Thank you.

Peyton:                                                27:24                                             Awesome. Any other questions?

Dumebi:                                                27:27                                             Please ask, ask away someone. I'll get someone in the background. Yeah.

Audience:                                              27:38                                             Um, well thank you for sharing your guys' experience. Um, as a freshman, I feel like hearing this is kind of nerve-wracking cause I don't even know what I wanna major in, let alone what my junior project is gonna look like. Um, if you guys can talk about your experience from like freshman year trying to navigate the gates. What, um, I guess figuring out what you want to do and then kind of figuring out what your junior project looked like and how that ties into what you want to become and how it ties into your nature.

Peyton:                                                28:11                                             I'll be the first to say I've had a very confusing path at Cornell. Many of you may recall my fashion major era. Um, not an era that I like to reflect on very kindly. Yeah, it was very questionable for some reason. I think honestly the best advice I could give you is take classes you enjoy. I went into college midlife crisis in the middle of Covid being like, I'm going to reinvent myself. I did in fact not reinvent myself and went right back to math and CS <laugh>. Um, but at the time I thought fashion was going to be my passion. Um, and so I just followed it. So take classes that you really enjoy. Um, listened to your advisor on the side. I came in wanting to take four fashion classes and my advisor was like, listen, Peyton, you did Science Olympiad and math athletes in high school. Let's tone it down a little bit. And that has obviously become my double major. Um, and then from there I just started taking classes that sounded really interesting. Reading rate my professor was really, really helpful. Avoiding those really uncomfortable situations where you could be getting a professor that maybe is a little boring to listen to and lecture. Um, and then just talking to other people. I think I've asked probably one too many questions about classes he's taken. Um, and just listening to your friends, what they're taking and just kind of having fun with it. Cause you're only here for four years, maybe five. Um, and so crossed. Um, and so just really listening to your peers,

Dumebi:                                                29:41                                             Peyton has what Peyton said. Listening to your peers. I'll actually give a counterintuitive advice. Sometimes you shouldn't listen to them because people only know as much as their experiences know. And sometimes what you want to do goes beyond what you know. So I'll give an example. I'll just give a short biography by myself. So I came in also, didn't do Science Olympic. I did First Robotics instead. I came in doing a lot of those kind of classes. My parents were like, why didn't you just apply to engineering instead? And I was like, no, I want to learn about society. And I still wanted to do CS so I wanted to combine both CS route didn't work the way I wanted, but I found the intro sci minor instead. And that worked really well for me. So my semester usually consists of two writing intensive classes. So reading like 20 pages or more worth of like dense social theory. And then the next day I have a problem set in probability due and then I have a code assignment. That's kind of what my semesters are like. And in a language, I love learning languages. So it's like one back to back. That kind of coursework. I don't recommend it for everyone <laugh>, but I don't recommend it's, I don't recommend it for everyone. But I think that's what I felt I needed to reinvent myself because I realized the way I thought about the world coming in didn't really make much sense. And I, and my, my bet is that the world, the way the world is going, they're we're gonna meet people who understand the subject very, very well, but also very, very comfortable with computers and using and talking to people in that, in that language, in that terminology. Yes. People, I took a lot of classes and some of them didn't go so well. Some of them went great, but I always, my take is that with what I've gained, let me give back to other people. So Peyton has asked me lots of questions a lot of other people have asked for and I give advice. I actually, Peyton and I are in multi variable calculus together. So our past see why you see past intersect, like I said before. So we've, so things come full circle. Um, I still want to continue my education cause I'm a nerd. I, I want to continue being in school, but I I, and I think that all that knowledge, all those experiences will eventually benefit me and they have so far and I think they'll continue to do so.

Coco:                                                  31:56                                             So for me, I feel like, um, just feel like curious and explore different things. Like I came in as a psychology major, but I'm like very curious in a lot of things and I just wanna like explore around since like general education is just a good opportunity to just like mess around and take different classes and see what you are actually interested in because you come in usually like, you don't like know what the major is or know what you're gonna learn about. So you, if you really want to dive in into that project real quick, it's kind of like intimidating. So I just like looked around a little lot. So, um, I also had the period where I was taking a lot of random classes. I took philosophy, which did not work out. I took an econ, which did not work out. Um, and I also took, um, law kind of worked out, but like, um, and then I took CS I guess like, um, I really liked the experience of actually like making something out of like, um, nothing which like CS kind of like fills into that where I can just like create things in there. Um, and I guess like, um, my experience was just to like explore around until you find something that you are really interested in. Cuz I've like messed around with academics and industry and like a lot of different things. Um, and like even now, I still haven't decided like my, whether I should go into industry or academics after I graduate. But like, I feel like it is just like an experience of like constant, like exploration and things will sort itself out.

Peyton:                                                33:37                                             Awesome. I wanna make sure that we have time for a lovely networking event and for people to eat the majority of why some of us are here.

Dumebi:                                                33:45                                             Food is good. <laugh> don't go hungry.

Peyton:                                                33:51                                             Yeah, go ahead.

V:                                                     33:54                                             I'm gonna pretend this is on even if it's not cool. Yes. So, um, uh, we have set up the food. Please don't eat in this room. If you do, I will throw you out of the room. Um, like it's against the rules. Please don't eat in this room. Um, and also before I dismiss you for food, so please listen, please, please, please. We have movie night happening this week. This is the, uh, we have decided that movie night will no longer be weekly. It'll be monthly. And so, uh, we have movie night this week and then not again until halfway through April. Um, so do take note of that. Um, I don't know what we're gonna be watching. I usually leave it up to a vote. Um, and, uh, we've had a lot of fun in the past. Um, Crystal's not here. I was gonna say Crystal and I just like talked about Sims. It was great. Anyway, um, what time? Naps right? Thank you. Six 30 on, uh, Saturday. Um, and then we end whenever you guys leave, we can watch as many movies as you want. Um, where is, hmm? Where, where, where is that one? 30 Rockefeller. 1 33. Okay. Um, and we provide for the most part Domino's Pizza because that's all I have access to. Um, and um, second thing when it comes to food. Um, last time that we had food, we ordered a specific number of vegan options and then all of them disappeared and none of the vegans were able to eat. So in this case, I want the vegans and ve yes, it happened. I was very upset. Uh, this time I want the vegans and vegetarians to get up first and walk around into the other room. Do not go through that door. Walk around. Vegans and vegetarians. You get to go first

Peyton:                                                35:31                                             Before the vegans and vegetarians go. Please be reminded that the networking event is right after this. It'll be in the front room on the right and if you're in 2110, I was a TA for that class. If you have any last minute questions,

Coco:                                                  35:44                                             Ask the vet,

Peyton:                                                35:46                                             Vegan and vegetarians. Feel free. All right.

Coco:                                                  35:49                                             Vegans and vegetarian.
