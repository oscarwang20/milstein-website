Speaker 1:                                             00:11                                             Great. And what are your interests like outside of academics or professional life?

Speaker 2:                                             00:15                                             Outside of academics, I'm definitely interested in music. I play cello, so I really like classical music, those types of ensembles. I also, um, fenced a lot throughout high school, so I'm in the recreational fencing club here at Cornell. Yeah.

Speaker 1:                                             00:28                                             That's cool. Uh, what's the name of the company where you'll be interning?

Speaker 2:                                             00:32                                             Um, this upcoming summer I'll be interning at Capital One in, um, McLean, Virginia.

Speaker 1:                                             00:38                                             Great. And, okay. And how long will the internship should be?

Speaker 2:                                             00:42                                             Um, it should be about 10 weeks, so starting in June through, um, August. August.

Speaker 1:                                             00:46                                             Okay. And uh, was it, is it paid?

Speaker 2:                                             00:48                                             It is paid. Um, it pays very well.

Speaker 1:                                             00:51                                             Yeah. Uh, would you be willing to share like, like a number?

Speaker 2:                                             00:55                                             Um, I do not remember the exact number cuz they give it in terms of biweekly pay. Okay. But I think biweekly it's over 4,000. So annual it hits around between like 90 and a hundred K.

Speaker 1:                                             01:07                                             Gotcha. Okay. Uh, and how do you get this internship?

Speaker 2:                                             01:11                                             Um, I think I applied to this internship or found it through Handshake, which is like the platform that Cornell uses, um, to help students like find jobs similar to like LinkedIn and stuff like that. Um, I applied to a lot of things on there, um, through there as well as just finding opportunities on Handshake and then going to their personal website and applying. Yeah.

Speaker 1:                                             01:30                                             Gotcha. Have you had like, uh, contact with someone in the company who's helped you, like get paprepared for it? Like have you done something to prepare yourself for the summer?

Speaker 2:                                             01:43                                             Um, in terms of the first part of recruitment and applying to the job, I didn't have anyone I knew at the company or anything like that, but as soon as I, you know, did the pre-testing, I believe they had like a, I forgot what they're called, but those types of, um, not technical interviews that you do by yourself, but I think I had a HireVue and then I had, um, like it was a, where I forgot what they're called. They're not technical because it's not exactly a technical role. It's um, A case interview. I had a case interview, so what they did was send me like data and I had to answer some questions about the data and analyze it basically not exactly a technical interview, but yeah, I had that. And then after that point, um, I actually ended up not getting invited to a second follow up interview because they had filled all the slots that year, but the following year in 2023, like after winter break, they contacted me and said, we have slots for 2023 and we're interested in interviewing you. Um, and at that point I was put in contact with a Cornell alumni at Cornell or at Capital One, Uhhu that, um, scheduled meetings with me personally just as an alumni to help me answer questions and actually walked me through a practice case interview. Um, since this job was definitely something that was not exactly the field I was originally applying for, I'd never actually done case interviews and those types of technical like challenges um, to during my job application process. So that mentor was really helpful and just kind of walking me through like what do they actually expect me to talk about, um, since, you know, it's preparing for an exam, but I had never taken this type of exam before, so.

Speaker 1:                                             03:15                                             What that was someone that Capital one connected you to?

Speaker 2:                                             03:17                                             Yeah, so I had a Capital One recruiter who was super helpful and responsive and she was great. Um, and then also mentioned that I would be, they're called like Capital One buddies. Okay. But it's really just an alumni who currently still works there.

Speaker 1:                                             03:29                                             That makes sense. Yeah. Uh, do you have any tips for other people who want a similar internship?

Speaker 2:                                             03:34                                             I would say definitely for me it was my, this first round of applying for internships after doing the Millstein summer program, I hadn't like done an internship in college yet. And so definitely just throw your resume everywhere. Um, for me, I don't exactly know the exact career path I want to do, so I was throwing my resume at like operations type jobs, data science, software engineering, like all sorts of things um, even things that you might not feel qualified for because it's an internship and you don't have to be qualified for them. So definitely just going out everywhere and definitely following up because when they didn't, I would wait a long time for people to reply to me and when they didn't, um, have space for me, you know, reaching out and continuing to be like, oh, do you like asking if this is like goodbye slash because they rephrased it as this is not goodbye, we'll contact you if anything happens. And for me, I actually didn't contact them for a long time and all of a sudden they threw this interview at me and I feel like I definitely would give advice that like, you should probably contact them about that because I had almost like already accepted another offer and it was a whole mess and so I had to go through all that. So I think just being following up with recruiters, especially if they're visibly engaged with you is good.

Speaker 1:                                             04:41                                             Gotcha. Yeah. Uh, do you take any classes or anything at Cornell that you feel like prepared you better for this internship?

Speaker 2:                                             04:48                                             The, so my internship is gonna be in business analytics, which is similar to data science, but I think more of a practical solution like you're presenting solutions as opposed to technically modifying like manipulating data. Um, and so if fits my personality type a little better, which I think is good that I found this role. Um, I know in the interview process I took last semester when I was applying, I took INFO 3300, which is data driven web applications where we basically created data visualizations and although it doesn't exactly line up with what I was doing, I had that on my resume and my website as my projects. And it really impressed a lot of employers being able to talk about something that I'd just recently done and actually having like something that's on the internet that people can play with and look at and look at before we talk about our interviews and stuff so any, for me, I would say like any sort of project that you're actively engaged in, in classes that you're able to, you know, post somewhere or show them what you've done is really engaging in will help you in any way, even if it's not directly related to what you're applying to share

Speaker 1:                                             05:47                                             A personal website that like had projects and stuff. Yeah. Yeah. That's about it then. Yeah.

Speaker 2:                                             05:52                                             Okay, great.

Speaker 1:                                             05:53                                             <laugh>.
