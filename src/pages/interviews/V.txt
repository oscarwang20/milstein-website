Hi.
0:02
I'm here with V Smith.
0:06
She's a current senior at Cornell and a major in environment and sustainability.
0:15
I'm here here to talk about her experience at Cornell these four years end of the Millstein Program as well as any tips that she might have for younger Milsteiners interested in her major or just listening to.
0:30
I'm graduating in 2023.
0:38
Can you tell us about yourself?
0:41
what are you interested in?
0:43
Yeah.
0:44
I am a senior, as you just said, very interested in Sims.
0:49
I know way too much about it.
0:52
and I'm very interested in Marvel and animals and, the concept of peace, although I don't really know like where to go with that.
1:07
So I majored in environmental sustainability and I minored in animal science with the, well, the major was so that I could graduate if we're being entirely honest because I came in thinking I was going to be a double major.
1:22
I thought I'd be in psych and do environmental sustainability.
1:26
And then I realized the psych classes here are a little above my pay grade even though I love psych.
1:31
just with so I took them in freshman year and freshman year was very chaotic for me and I have mental health issues which I can get into later if we have time.
1:40
But just was not working well, especially when COVID hit in the middle of my second semester.
1:47
So, like, everything just threw a psych out of the window for me.
1:50
So I stayed with environmental sustainability because those were the classes that I had the highest grades in and therefore could maintain my GPA.
1:58
And so I did that and then, in the middle of junior year, I was like, I don't know what I'm gonna do with this.
2:05
I don't know what I would do with this major, but I really like animals and if I don't have an animal class, I'm gonna be very sad.
2:11
And so I started looking at the animal science classes and, decided very quickly that this was going to be my minor when I learned that, you only need 15 credits to do an animal science minor.
2:24
So that, that's really easy.
2:26
You could do it in one semester if there were enough classes that you were interested in and, and whatever.
2:30
So, it wasn't until probably the beginning of this year, my senior year that I decided that, with my minor, I'm going to focus more on zoos.
2:43
So I know for a fact that I'm not interested in cows or sheep or other farm animals, which is what most of animal science is, at least at Cornell because we have a lot of farm kids here.
2:55
But, I picked classes that would give me the basics at the very least for general animals.
3:04
So, like I took, nutrition, animal nutrition. I was going to take something about felines and canids, just cats and dogs.
3:17
I don't remember if I did take that, but I was going to because I would hope to work with big cats.
3:25
So having, excuse me, domestic cat information would be great.
3:29
They are different but very similar.
3:34
And then I worked with, Doctor Jeremy Allen.
3:41
He's wonderful and he's in, animal science, existence over there.
3:48
And he helped me come up with ways to make my minor work for me as opposed to me just taking these dairy cattle classes and, and hating myself because I'm not interested in that.
4:02
so he helped me do an independent study last semester.
4:07
so he was my advisor for that and mine, which was directed at figuring out what I'm going to do with the rest of my life, put some quotes on that.
4:17
Like I figure out what I'm gonna do anyway.
4:22
so that was great.
4:26
He helped me meet my credit requirement with that.
4:30
And I looked into being a rehabilitator and then with that, I looked into how to get a rehabilitation license and I have a pseudo one which means that I cannot actively rehabilitate any animals.
4:53
But I do know the steps now to, to rehabilitate and I do know the steps that would get me a rehabilitation license.
5:01
Can you talk about how you went about?
5:03
Like, how did you hear about, you know, getting a rehabilitation license?
5:06
How did you, you know, get interested in that?
5:08
This was this Google, Google, right.
5:11
My dad, I think this was mostly over COVID but my dad started watching, first of all, he's always been interested in science shows and nature documentaries and stuff and I'm, he probably found, this show, I don't remember what it's called, but it's these rehabilitators running around and saving these animals.
5:31
and the one that I happened to walk into, they were saving some parrots and I have no interest in birds, but I loved how attentive they were to these birds and how, how much they were like, yeah, this isn't ok.
5:47
You'd think that this is ok because you're just gonna buy it from your local breeder, but your local breeder doesn't know what they're doing.
5:52
And, and so it show this, this show emphasized the destructive nature that can come with not properly taking care of your animals, domestic or wild.
6:08
And so, or just, even if you properly take care of your animal, even if you do everything you can to protect them, they still might get sick.
6:17
And so, like they did surgery on a cheetah that had something wrong with it.
6:22
I don't remember.
6:23
And they were taking care of their cheetah.
6:25
It's just the cheetah that's sick.
6:28
So I looked at that and I was like, oh, I want to do something like that.
6:33
That would get me what I really want to do, which is hug a bear.
6:37
I want, I want, you know, those, those, shows of wolves and, and wild cats and bear cubs and whatever.
6:48
And they see this person who, who rescued them like the caption is this person rescued this animal when they were very, very young and it's been years since they've seen them and then the animal just like pounces on them and just loves them.
7:01
I want that, but I'm not stupid enough to go out in the wild and just pick up a random bear.
7:07
So if I can work with animals that for whatever reason can't be released, which means they have to be in human, companionship, not necessarily owned, not necessarily a pet, but they have to be worked with like, humans have to be around them then that'd be great because they're not domestic, but they are a little more docile and maybe, maybe I'll be able to, touch them and interact with them and love on them the way that I want to.
7:36
And, excuse me.
7:40
So, mhm.
7:44
A way to get to doing that to that, to get a way to be able to do, to do that is to either work in rehabilitation or work in zoos under rehabilitation.
7:54
So, my major turned into, all right, I'm gonna work in a zoo.
7:59
I'm gonna become the next Steve Irwin.
8:01
I'm gonna be a conservationist.
8:02
I'm gonna protect these animals.
8:05
I'm gonna rehabilitate bats apparently.
8:07
Like I just threw anything to the wall and I'm seeing what sticks and, so far nothing has stuck in the sense that, like, I don't have any promises afterwards, but I do have things I'm interested in.
8:19
Like, I still really, really wanna work, with these large animals.
8:24
I still really wanna, show them the love that they probably need, especially the ones that are in not necessarily good, situations.
8:32
And honestly, if I just work with domestic dogs, like that's fine with me too because, tipples obviously need some love, right?
8:41
So, if I may, I mean, it's fascinating to hear you talk about all this stuff and, I think, especially from the point of view, like, you know, considering in the context, like of the program where so many of us are like, you know, CS and info majors.
8:57
It's really refreshing to hear somebody, you know, who has someone as unique as a major and a minor as you.
9:02
So, what sort of tips would you have for somebody, like, in a similar position to you as well?
9:08
Like, say, you know, a freshman down the road that's looking to major in something like you know, animal science or environmental sustainability.
9:16
Like, what, what sort of tips do you have for that?
9:18
How would you go like around like just like leveraging Cornell leveraging the Milstein Program to really take advantage of, of your passion as unique as it might be?
9:29
I make everything I do work for me.
9:32
So I am probably not gonna guarantee that, but I am probably the first who's not CS or info to declare a major.
9:42
Like I, I told Maya I'm not taking any more CS classes after the first one.
9:48
She was like, oh, ok, great, cool.
9:50
Why?
9:51
And I was like, yeah.
9:52
And so I didn't, I took, I took Python and then I was like, all right, I'm done.
9:58
So and it's not that I didn't like it.
10:00
It's that it took me 28 hours a week, so it's not sustainable.
10:06
So now we're in sustainability anyway.
10:10
So what I would say for any aspiring m sooner, aspiring college person just do what you can do, do what you are comfortable with, but also kind of push those, those boundaries.
10:27
So, I picked, I said CS and I picked environmental sustainability and psychology because those were my two favorite classes in college.
10:45
And then when one didn't work, I still had the other one to fall back on.
10:51
One of my high school English teachers told me that she changed her major like 20 times before she graduated and she found that she didn't have a reason.
11:01
She didn't feel like she had a reason to get up in the morning if she didn't have an English class in her schedule.
11:09
And I find myself feeling very similar, which is why animal science became my minor.
11:16
I didn't feel like getting up if I didn't get to see animals.
11:21
Right.
11:21
And living on campus, I don't have an animal.
11:27
and back home I no longer have an animal.
11:33
and so I don't get to interact with them very often.
11:38
And so pursuing a career that allows me to do exactly what I want to do or do something that I love.
11:44
That was what was important to me.
11:46
I picked what was important to me and I worked towards it.
11:48
More on making everything, work for you.
11:54
I have four jobs.
11:55
I have to pay for college.
11:58
and, and I need to cut corners where I can so I don't have a meal plan.
12:04
But how do I eat on campus?
12:06
Oh, because I work in the dining halls.
12:08
I work, I actually no longer work in the dining hall.
12:11
I work in a cafe but it's the same, same company, the same part.
12:15
and so I get to eat three times a week, like three days of the week I am fed.
12:24
Buy my job.
12:27
Then you got Milstein on Wednesday and Friday and sometimes I get fed there.
12:31
So I made sure that I was getting food most of the time.
12:37
I wanted a gym membership but I can't afford a gym membership because I just like, I can't, I need to cut corners where I can.
12:45
So I work at the gym now.
12:48
and then I worked for Milstein as well because I have to take the classes anyway, I have to be an M studio.
12:54
I have to actually, I don't have to because I'm a senior, but I also did have to because I was low on arts credits, which is its own fight.
13:04
So M sSudio helped me increase the amount that I had and, and so that was necessary.
13:10
And, and I would, and I would like, get paid for that because of Milstein.
13:17
And then my junior project was about making Milstein better, which I did through working here.
13:22
And so I got paid to do a lot of stuff and I made, everything that I did work for me so that I could capitalize on everything possible.
13:30
Does that mean that I missed out on clubs?
13:32
Yes.
13:33
Am I a very sociable person in the sake of clubs?
13:36
Not really.
13:36
I actually don't like them.
13:37
, they're great for other people.
13:39
They're not great for me.
13:41
I feel much more at place when I am in control of the situation and because I work for Milstein and because I work for, the dining hall, I am in control of those settings.
13:50
So I play a hand in what Milstein looks like and therefore I am in control.
13:59
I play a hand in how the dining hall functions because I work there.
14:05
Whereas if I was in a club, yeah, I play a hand in how the club works, but I'm not the president probably.
14:11
And therefore I don't have the last say and that's fine, but not for me, right?
14:19
And so I don't, I'm not in any clubs and like just to connect this back to like what you would recommend for like a no or just like, I guess like the way it sounds is like, you know, you know, you're not interested in clubs but, but you, you definitely found a way to make your impact on campus like that.
14:35
I mean, I see you personally, I can attest to this, I've seen you everywhere everywhere, just working, doing something, right?
14:42
Like, everywhere I see V Smith, you know, so like, yeah, I mean, you've definitely, you've definitely found ways to have a presence here, be involved in the community and I think that's really commendable.
14:54
So, yeah, is there any other, any other advice that you'd like to give before we wrap this up to, to a that that's interested?
15:00
Don't be afraid to be yourself.
15:02
I am unapologetically myself to the point where it might get me in trouble and you know what?
15:08
I don't regret it.
15:09
I made, I made some of my best friends here because I am unapologetically myself and they are themselves and we get to clash and butt heads.
15:19
We also get to just goof off and enjoy each other.
15:24
One of the reasons I love Milstein is because of how different all the students are and like how, yeah, how different everyone is.
15:34
We last year, I was talking to somebody about this and we were like, what is the minority of Milstein?
15:39
The minority of campus is like people of color, like you can pick someone, I'm sure we found that the, the minority of Milstein is neurotypical cisgender, white males.
15:54
That's, that's pretty, it's a pretty big deal as a neurodivergent person of color, LGBT female.
16:06
Like that's, that's pretty important for me that I am no longer the minority and I am fully accepted here.
16:14
And so, yeah, and if somebody doesn't accept you, you don't need to deal with them, you can just cut them out of your life and if you can't, if they're in your cohort, there's, there's things that can be done, like, like you can just talk to someone.
16:32
And so yeah, just be yourself.
16:37
Just keep being your lovable goofball self and don't, don't, yeah, don't change for anybody.
16:47
V Smith, everybody!
16:48
Thank you.
16:50
Thanks for time!
16:50
Be safe.
16:51
Have fun.
16:52
Don't die.
