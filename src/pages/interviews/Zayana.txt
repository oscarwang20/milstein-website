Speaker 2:                                             00:00                                             So what's your name?

Speaker 1:                                             00:07                                             Yeah. Hi, my name is Zayana and I'm a sophomore at Cornell. I'm studying computer science and I'm studying it in arts and sciences, and I'm part of the Milstein program. I'm also doing a minor in business, most probably.

Speaker 2:                                             00:20                                             Oh, okay. Great. Uh, do you have any other interests, extracurricular in college or any clubs or something you're part of?

Speaker 1:                                             00:26                                             Sure. So I'm part of a consulting club called, um, like Cornell Strategic Consulting. And I'm also part, I'm also project team lead for another consulting club called SEEPAC, which is, which is, uh, students from emerging economies. Um, um, association at Cornell. I think that's the full form.

Speaker 2:                                             00:46                                             So, uh, where did you intern?

Speaker 1:                                             00:48                                             Um, so I, last summer I didn't do an internship. I was actually at Cornell Tech for the summer, so, um, sure that could be considered an internship because you do work with like external companies. But I mean, in terms of a pure internship, in the internship sense, I interned at this, uh, company in my hometown of Mumbai. And, um, this company is called, uh, IQD FinTech, and they basically are a FinTech form that provide financial solutions to a lot of other businesses. So they run B2B mostly. And, uh, one of their major offerings and the department that I was working with is their cybersecurity department, and it was a Zoom internship because it was during COVID.

Speaker 2:                                             01:23                                             Okay, great. Uh, how long was this internship?

Speaker 1:                                             01:26                                             It was about two months.

Speaker 2:                                             01:27                                             Two months. Okay. And do you, was it a paid internship or unpaid?

Speaker 1:                                             01:30                                             It was an unpaid internship also because I was in, I had just finished high school at that time. Okay. So in India there are certain laws that, um, at a certain age you can't get paid, um, even if you're working . So, um, that would've been a, like slightly, uh, problematic legal loophole to get into, not loophole, but like a wormhole to get into. So it was an unpaid internship for the experience.

Speaker 2:                                             01:51                                             Got it. And what was the process of getting this internship? Right? Was it referred, was it an application? How did that work?

Speaker 1:                                             01:55                                             Sure. So, uh, it was a combination of a referral and an application. So let me explain it to you. So I, um, my school, uh, basically, um, does a partnership with a lot of companies, um, whether they are from like companies that alumni are working at, um, owned by alumni and stuff like that. And they basically have a large repository and, uh, you can send in an application; you can fill out a Google form talking like, which basically, um, where you basically have to answer certain questions about what you're interested in, uh, what sectors you want to explore as a potential career option and various other like academic and extracurricular interests. And you get matched with three or four firms, uh, who are part of that database that you'd fit well into in terms of your interests. And from there, it's a matter of contacting them. And, um, oftentimes you're putting, you're introduced through email and you're told, oh, me so and so who's an alumni from our school. And, um, you know, they sometimes send you a form to fill out in terms of like your resume, um, your transcript, and maybe an occasional application essay. And from there, um, it becomes like an application process wherein you are in touch with someone. So you do have a person who is willing to vouch for you if you had a Zoom conversation with them or a phone conversation with them. but it is a very like, um, uh, formal process.

Speaker 2:                                             03:13                                             Okay. Got it. Uh, in terms of what your expectations were going in and after the internship, what would, what overall rating were you out of 10?

Speaker 1:                                             03:20                                             I think I'd give my internship a 7.5.

Speaker 2:                                             03:23                                             Yeah. Okay. Like, elaborate on what, like where it, like fell, fell short or like where it met your expectations.

Speaker 1:                                             03:29                                             Sure. So I think going in, uh, this was my first internship, so going in, I didn't have a, I didn't know what to expect, but, you know, you have a lot of preconceived expectations. Uh, I think, um, one of my major expectations that I think was like that wasn't met completely was the amount of face time or the amount of face time I'd be getting with my, uh, with the team who actually works there. And it was not just me was an intern. There were like two other interns. There was three interns, and there was a team who like works on this project, like full-time who were like five or six people. And I imagine a lot of this is to do with the fact that it was on Zoom and it was, not actually in the office, but, I felt like the amount of FaceTime I got through with them was very little. It was like once every 10 days we'd have a Zoom check-in. Um, and, uh, I feel like, uh, in terms of like accessibility, I was expecting there to be a little bit more of a, um, you know, we'll maybe be meeting twice a week and we'll be finding out what the team has been up to. And you know, they'd be giving us feedback like, like twice every week. At least on, um, the project that we had been working on, uh, as interns. Um, but that was not the case. So I think that was something that, um, I went in expecting but didn't fully get when, at the end of the internship. Um, however, one thing that, that I think that went well and that my expectations were met in was that, um, I was hoping to learn something new through this internship. Something that had not been taught in class or, I mean, obviously I wanted to like, have some knowledge going in, but also, you know, there's only certain theoretical aspects that are taught in class or that you can learn like online through web. There's completely different ball game if you wanna like, actually create an application. And I think, um, at that, until that point, I didn't have a lot of experience with like Python because when I had done CS in school, or I had done it in Java, so this was like an opportunity and like an incentive almost for me to like go out of my way and learn Python. And I think the internship was super, like people at the internship was super helpful in terms of like giving a set of resources. So I right at the beginning we got a whole document, which, uh, was like the basics of Python, slightly more complicated projects that you can pick up on the side, Python being used in stuff like ML and like machine learning, which at that point was completely new to me, um, as like, I'd never done an ML PRO program before or like a, a reinforcement learning program before. And, um, so I think that was something that the internship did well in terms of providing me with an incentive and resources to pick up a new skill and apply that skill. .

Speaker 2:                                             05:46                                             Got it. Uh, so what, what was your role exactly as an intern? Did you rotate between different departments? Did different things? Or was it like one set thing for two months?

Speaker 1:                                             05:54                                             Sure. So it was, I was, I was not a rotational intern. I, I was working with one sub-team, uh, that works full-time at IQD. I was working with the cybersecurity, uh, subteam, actually one of the sub-teams in the cybersecurity department. And, uh, that project initially, like basically was, um, that they were working on a, like a model that could recognize faces and, um, and eventually like, you know, if it's a green face, which basically means that someone who's trying to access it is allowed to access it, the particular document or whatever, you know, uh, confidential, uh, file would be, you know, they'd be allowed to open it through facial recognition. And on the other hand, if it was, if it the bot wasn't able to recognize the face, they would, you know, it would be like, you can't really access it, you don't have the controls. Right. So, uh, that was what the team was working on full-time. And we got like a, we got like small tasks, so like, to start us off, they were like, oh, like, you know, they, they gave us off a lot of like open AI source code and they said, okay, fiddle around with this. And basically like, we were given like, maybe, like, it was basically ran in two week sprints. So we were given a task of like modifying a source code that they gave us, uh, which is basically open, like open interface and basically like make the, like train the data, like train the data set on the Indian cricket team so that in a picture, if you saw, if you saw like the main five people at that time who were in the main cricket team, they would be identified and they would be circled. So that's how it started. So it was smaller projects and we were working with a smaller sub team, um, and it was definitely not rotional.

Speaker 2:                                             07:21                                             Got it. Uh, so you spoke about how they helped you in the company with like a document and the resources and stuff. What other support did you get from people in the company? Like was it just, uh, like resource support for the internship itself? Or was it support for career development beyond that, uh, connections, networking opportunities, future offers? Like how will you, how are you helped as an intern during this process?

Speaker 1:                                             07:42                                             Sure. So I don't think there was a lot of emphasis on networking. Um, again, a lot of this could be contributed to the fact that it was, uh, during a time of COVID and a lot, not a lot of networking opportunities can be presented over Zoom. Uh, so I would say no to like, um, like long-term professional development. Uh, but I definitely think that was an opp, like I was given a letter of recommendation at the end, and I think that was also by like one of the mentors who was on the team who I had worked well pretty closely with. So I think it was a pretty, like, in terms of that aspect, I got some feedback on my work and I did get some, like more direction in terms of like getting, going into college. I kind of knew like, oh, maybe I do wanna dip my toes into this part, or maybe I don't. And also, um, so yeah, I, I don't think there was a lot of emphasis on networking and future, like, like further down the line career, development. No.

Speaker 2:                                             08:33                                             But you felt like you were supported throughout the process, like when it was, like when they gave you tasks to do, for example, you didn't know what to do with it or, or like you, you weren't sure how to proceed with it Yeah. Was there a lot of guidance and help with that?

Speaker 1:                                             08:42                                             Yeah, absolutely. I, I know that like, I could send an email, and I mean, sometimes it would take time to for people to respond, but I mean, obviously that's the case when someone's a full blown working professional. They also have like 10 other things that are, are on top of their list on the task list. So I would definitely be given help. And I mean, if not, like, I mean, sometimes people would like explain and answer the question directly. Sometimes I'll be given access to like, or like directed to certain resources that could help me. And I think that was also a good way for me to like, take initiative when I was given a resource and be like, okay, I've been given like these two or three, like potential websites that could help me solve, like the issue that I'm currently having. And I think a lot of times, like CS, being a, like software developer is about trying to find the answer yourselves with like stack overflow or whatever it is. So I think that was a good starting point for me to where I was not always given the solution on a silver platform, but I was given enough support that I was able to figure it out.

Speaker 2:                                             09:32                                             Got it. And what would you say were your biggest learnings after the internship?

Speaker 1:                                             09:36                                             Hmm. Um, my biggest learnings, well, I would say Python number one, because coming in here, I had like a little bit of a head start more than I would have otherwise, uh, with the first CS class at Cornell. Uh, but apart from that, apart from the technical skills, I think was definitely, um, like communication. Uh, because every, whenever we did have our check-ins every 10 days, uh, you did have to present what you did. You did have to like explain where you struggled or what you were currently struggling with. And I think that, um, up until that point, I wasn't able to very easily verbalize the problem, that I would have with my code, um, or like the small aspects of a certain, um, new concept that I was struggling with. So I think, uh, and I think that communication is a very important aspect of just being like working with a team, whether it's a technical team or a slightly more a business facing or client facing team. So I think, um, yeah, communicating my ideas better was something that I definitely came out, um, of the internship experience, uh, with.

Speaker 2:                                             10:34                                             Got you. So from the time that you got the internship to when you started, how did you prepare for it? Like do anything before it? Did you like, uh, research, I don't know, like try to learn something new? Or was it just like you went show up on the first day and try to take it from there?

Speaker 1:                                             10:46                                             Um, so I didn't really do a lot before it. Uh, they did, I remember when it was confirmed, like it was, that was about a month and a half before like the internship was scheduled to start. They had given out, they'd given a whole document on what the company does and the different parts and the different subteams, uh, even the sub teams that you are not working with. And, um, that was a document I had read over in pretty great depth just because I wanted to know the company I was working for because that is something interesting always to keep an eye for. Uh, so that was something I did. And I also think maybe I had, I don't think I, know that in terms of expectations, it was just that you needed to know, maybe have a basic understanding of coding. Uh, and I had coded, I had done a CS class, but I hadn't done a CS class in the year before my internship. So I felt the need to brush up on that. So I did, uh, maybe review a few of like my old, um, like notes I think, or like maybe a few things. I like look back on a few projects that I had done just to make sure that, you know, getting in I was not completely blank.

Speaker 2:                                             11:46                                             Sure. And so if somebody opposed to like do internships similar to that in cybersecurity, CS or coding, uh, would you have any tips for them? Like how would they approach it? Uh, what to do beforehand? How to prepare best for it, that sort of thing?

Speaker 1:                                             11:58                                             Um, so I think one important thing is that, I mean, if you have an interest in something, you should always be, uh, willing to like, um, follow that interest outside of class. So there's a lot of cybersecurity classes at Cornell, but oftentimes there's a freshman and sophomore, you don't, you can't really do them because you're still doing the core classes, the introductory level classes. What you can do on the other hand is go up to, you know, online resources, which are like, you know, you have Udemy, you have Coursera, you have these types of things and maybe like do like a short, like watch a short video on it just so that you have an understanding. So when eventually you do reach out to a potential employer, um, they won't expect you to know it all because you are ultimately a student and you're applying to be an intern. You're not applying, you're not applying to be a full-time, uh, person who, who, I mean not, not are you claiming to know everything about that particular subject, let's say cybersecurity. But it definitely helps knowing the basics, um, and showing initiative of like self, of like learning stuff by yourself outside of class, because then it shows that your interest is genuine. And, um, I think that is something that helped me because cybersecurity is not something that is taught in high school at least. And, um, nor is it covered in those curriculums, but just the fact that I was interested in it enough to like, um, you know, uh, watch a few things about it. And like, you know, demonstrate that interest I think was good. And I think that is something I would recommend.

Speaker 2:                                             13:15                                             Okay. Good. And would it be possible for you to write a referral for this like position, for this internship?

Speaker 1:                                             13:19                                             Sorry, what?

Speaker 2:                                             13:19                                             Would it be possible for you to write a referral for this position on this internship for somebody else? Uh, yeah,

Speaker 1:                                             13:23                                             I think I could record. Okay. Yeah.

Speaker 2:                                             13:25                                             Perfect. Yep. That's it. Quick.
