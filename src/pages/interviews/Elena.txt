Speaker 2:                                             00:06                                             Sure. Uh, my name is Elena Ault. I am a junior. I'm in the Millstein program. Obviously I'm an economics major with minors in business and real estate, and I'm from Connecticut.

Speaker 1:                                             00:18                                             Perfect. And what are your interests outside of your major, like on campus or things you do in your free time, that sort of thing?

Speaker 2:                                             00:25                                             Sure. So I guess for fun I really like cooking and baking. I live off campus and am thankful to have access to a kitchen and cook whenever I want.

Speaker 1:                                             00:34                                             Perfect. Uh, so where did you intern last summer? The name of the company?

Speaker 2:                                             00:38                                             Sure. This past summer I interned at Morgan Stanley. And

Speaker 1:                                             00:40                                             Where was that?

Speaker 2:                                             00:41                                             In New York.

Speaker 1:                                             00:42                                             And uh, how long was the internship?

Speaker 2:                                             00:44                                             10 weeks.

Speaker 1:                                             00:45                                             So that's, uh, two and a half months approximately? Yes. Yeah. Uh, did you get paid for it?

Speaker 2:                                             00:49                                             I did.

Speaker 1:                                             00:50                                             Oh, sorry. How much was the compensation?

Speaker 2:                                             00:52                                             Um, it was hourly. Um, for my sophomore internship it was prorated on a $110,000. Like base,

Speaker 1:                                             01:02                                             Like yearly thing?

Speaker 2:                                             01:03                                             Yeah. But like prorated for 10 weeks. Okay. So I forget what that comes out to.

Speaker 1:                                             01:07                                             Got you. Uh, so how do you get the internship? Like what was the process of like looking for applying for it, that entire thing?

Speaker 2:                                             01:15                                             Sure. So, um, my freshman spring I began networking with employees at the firm and submitted my application for the summer after my sophomore year in July, after my freshman year. Um, so about a year in advance I did a HireVue interview, so like a virtual, um, interview for them that was just behavioral questions. And then about two weeks later got a super day final round and then heard back the next day. So,

Speaker 1:                                             01:44                                             So you heard back in like August, September,

Speaker 2:                                             01:47                                             Still July.

Speaker 1:                                             01:49                                             So you heard back in July? Yeah. For like, so you, you knew you were gonna intern Morgan Stanley a year before it began? Yes.

Speaker 2:                                             01:54                                             Okay. So process from sending my application to my offer was about three weeks, super quick.

Speaker 1:                                             01:57                                             About three weeks? Yeah. Oh, okay. Uh, so how, what was that, the initial application, like, so did you have someone who you got referred from? Do you network somewhere or did you supply on the online portal?

Speaker 2:                                             02:06                                             Um, I networked, I'm not sure if I had any referrals, but just applied on the portal.

Speaker 1:                                             02:12                                             Okay. Yeah. Perfect. You go for any like Morgan Stanley events on campus or like speak to someone beforehand?

Speaker 2:                                             02:18                                             Um, I spoke to some alumni who I connected with over LinkedIn and then I went to a few diversity webinars that were non-selective, not really networking, just to learn more about the firm.

Speaker 1:                                             02:28                                             Got you. Perfect. So what do you do exactly in your role at Morgan Stanley?

Speaker 2:                                             02:32                                             Yeah, so, um, over the summer it was a lot of work in Excel and PowerPoint and really trying to make the lives of the analysts and associates I was working with easier. Um, so synthesizing information into decks, um, updating decks based on, you know, the volatility of the stock market and deals move so quickly. Um, also taking a stab at financial models and trying to support the analysts with inputs and error checking and things like that. But also had the opportunity to sit in on a lot of meetings with clients, take notes on earnings calls. So just a lot of Excel and PowerPoint mainly.

Speaker 1:                                             03:08                                             Got you. Uh, how was support in the company? Like as an incoming intern, did you get a lot of resources? Maybe someone, you can always contact if you got stuck on something. Uh, yeah. What was that like?

Speaker 2:                                             03:18                                             HR was super, um, present from the get-go if we had any logistical questions, which was nice, but the first two weeks of the internship were training, so regardless of which group you were in within their investment banking arm, everyone was in the same room going through training with a company called Financial Edge, where they tried to make sure everyone had the same foundational knowledge regardless of your background, where you go to school, all that sort of thing. So even the playing field made me feel less anxious going in.

Speaker 1:                                             03:43                                             Got it. What were your main learnings from the internship? Like after I got over, what do you think were your main takeaways or the main things that you grew as a, as a person

Speaker 2:                                             03:50                                             Sure. So I think one of the main things I learned from this summer was how to be resourceful and the importance of resourcefulness, which especially in investment banking, the people who you're reporting to and your managers are so busy that you don't want to be peppering them with questions constantly. Like you're there to make their job easier and also to learn. So, um, learning how to figure things out on your own, knowing what resources to go to and that if you are stuck coming to your manager with this is what I tried, this is who I asked, um, here are my specific questions. And it's, it's a skill I think to know when to stop spinning your wheels and when to ask for help.

Speaker 1:                                             04:30                                             Got you. Perfect. Uh, so how do you prepare for it since in this case you got an internship a year in advance, right? So do you do anything in that year? Do you take specific classes or like talk to people or like just do some online courses or something just to prepare better for the internship, and to know what you're getting into really.

Speaker 2:                                             04:46                                             Yeah, so I'm a business minor and I started that last year. I took finance and accounting, which is super key if you want to go into finance. But a specific class I took that was a bit unconventional, I think it's NBA 5111 or like foundations of financial modeling. It's a graduate class, it's open to undergrads. You're technically not supposed to take it until your junior year, but I enrolled and it was fine. Um, and they really went through the fundamentals of financial modeling and it was once a week. Super helpful.

Speaker 1:                                             05:16                                             Got you. Uh, so do you have any tips for others who want to do like a similar career trajectory, similar internships or something? Like is there something you should focus on? Uh, something you can get better at or do from like the beginning?

Speaker 2:                                             05:28                                             For a lot of finance roles, really a key thing is having understanding of the timelines just because they recruit so early. Like I said, I recruited a year in advance for my sophomore year and then for my junior year I'm also working in finance again and that was like a year and a half in advance. So even if you have all the skills and are extremely qualified, if you don't know that you have to apply, a year in advance and you're missing out on opportunities. So I guess it really starts your freshman year, like figuring out what firms you're interested in broadly and keeping tabs on their websites. And it's really helpful to have a group of people or to find a group of people who are also going through the recruiting process for your industry so you can keep each other updated as things are posted. Um, practice with them.

Speaker 1:                                             06:10                                             Yeah. Uh, would it be possible for you to write a referral for somebody else who wants like a similar role, like if someone from Milstein hit you up and said, could you refer me for the same like, uh, internship/job, could you do that?

Speaker 2:                                             06:20                                             I'm not returning to the firm. Okay. So like, no.

Speaker 1:                                             06:23                                             Okay. Cool. And overall, what would you rate the internship like, uh, from your expectations, like how it actually happened out? A 10

Speaker 2:                                             06:30                                             Mm I'd give it a 10 because I think that even though like I'm choosing to not return for my junior summer and explore other opportunity, I think that working investment banking sophomore year opens a lot of doors and that regardless of where you go afterwards, um, the learning opportunities and the network are unmatched and I really like the people in my group.

Speaker 1:                                             06:52                                             Got you. Perfect. Yeah, that was.
